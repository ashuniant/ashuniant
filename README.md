`LuaU developer` | `Graphic designer`

I'm a **LuaU developer** known for projects like **Tensen** (gpo hub discontinued), which had around 7,000 members on the Discord server. I've also worked on some other related projects, most of which I've worked on solo. I've been working on scripting for one year, mainly working on UI Libraries and hub projects. My goal is to focus on graphic design and the visualization aspect, striving for the highest quality and optimal stability to create exceptional projects in the future for users and myself.
